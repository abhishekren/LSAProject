    "# Latent Semantic Analysis: From Autoencoders to Embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part I: The Autoencoder\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we explore using an autoencoder for Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA). The goal of LSA is to embed words from running text into a latent space in a way that captures the structure and relatedness of these words. An autoencoder is a neural network which is designed to compress arbitrary high-dimensional data. To accomplish this, we start with a layer the size of the high-dimensional data, and iteratively feed this data into layers of lower and lower dimension until we reach a low-dimensional layer. We then feed data from this low dimensional layer into layers of higher and higher dimension, increasing the dimensionality back to the original dimensionality. Then, we train the network on a loss function which seeks to minimize the difference between inputs and outputs. The network then learns to optimally compress the high dimensional data in such a way that it can be restored with maximum accuracy. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"files/autoencoder-architecture.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "The autoencoder architecture is summarized above. Here are the specifications of the autoencoder we will use:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We use just three layers for our autoencoder: an input layer, a hidden layer representing the latent space, and an output layer.\n",
    "2. We will not introduce any nonlinearities on the first two layers. On the third layer, we will introduce a sigmoid function.\n",
    "3. We will train with cross-entropy loss to match the sigmoid of the last layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have yet to see how we will turn running text into data which our autoencoder can use. The first and most obvious step is to perform a one-hot encoding of the words we see in our text corpus. We may be tempted to naively try and compress the one-hot encodings by feeding them into the autoencoder one-by-one and backpropogating any difference between outputs and inputs. This will not work very well, because autoencoders can only compress data well when the high-dimensional data lies in some (perhaps nonlinear) low-dimensional subspace. Here, we have a data point corresponding to each unit vector (because of one-hot encoding), so the autoencoder is essentially trying to compress the entire space. The result is that the space cannot be compressed any more efficiently than a random linear embedding. This is not surprising in light of the fact that we haven't incorporated any information about the words and how they are related (other than that they are all distinct).\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this issue, we will instead train our autoencoder to output \"context words\" for a given input word. A \"context word\" $w'$ for a given input word $w$ is simply a word which appears near $w$ in the corpus. Our data matrix will simply be the identity, since we intend to train the autoencoder on one-hot encoding inputs. The target matrix has rows indexed by input and columns indexed by output, so the $(i, j)$th component of $y$ is 1 if the word $w'$ whose one-hot index is $j$ appears in within $L$ words of some appearance of $w$, the word whose one-hot index is $i$. Here $L$ is a hyperparameter, which we will refer to as the window size. Notice that the context words for a word $w$ are the words which appear within $2L$ of this word. When we construct $y$, we will do so by starting with all zeroes, indexing through the corpus, and for each center word $w$ and context word $w'$ at most $L$ indices away, we set the corresponding entry of $y$ to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "This form of LSA, called \"Continuous Bag of Words\" (CBOW) LSA, could also be see as the following classification problem: Given a pair $(w', w)$, classify $w'$ as either a context word for $w$ or not a context word for $w$. The output of the autoencoder in index $w'$ when run on the one-hot encoding of $w$ would then be the classification \"score\" of $(w', w)$: an output of 1 would imply that $w'$ always appears within $L$ of $w$, so $w'$ is certainly a context word, and an ouptut of 0 would imply that $w'$ never appears within $L$ of $w$, so $w'$ is certainly not a context word. \n",
    "\n",
    "Later, we will see an embedding-focused approach to CBOW LSA that is rooted in this classification problem, but instead randomly samples positive and negative examples $(w', w)$ on which to train. We will even prove that if we sample every possible example in this alternative model, our results will be identical to those achieved via the autoencoder. Moreover, this approach may be faster and yield better results when we reduce the number of negative examples to be balanced with the number of positive examples. Reducing the number of examples saves training time, and decreasing class imbalance typically improves performance. But first, let's implement the autoencoder and see it in action on a corpus of Wikipedia articles."

    "\n",
    "Now we elaborate upon the embedding-focused approach to Latent Semantic Analysis. In order to derive this approach, we need to name some elements of our autoencoder. For any input vector $\\mathbf{x}$, let $\\mathbf{\\phi}(\\mathbf{x})$ be the resulting hidden layer activations. Note that $\\mathbf{\\phi}(\\cdot)$ is a linear transformation from one-hot space into latent space since our hidden layer had no nonlinearity. Similarly, for any hidden layer activation vector $\\mathbf{h}$, let $\\mathbf{\\psi}^T(\\mathbf{h})$ be the pre-nonlinearity activations of the final layer; as the notation suggests, $\\mathbf{\\psi}^T(\\cdot)$ is then a linear transformation from latent space to one-hot space, and thus $\\mathbf{\\psi}(\\cdot)$ is a linear transformation from one-hot space to latent space (or more formally, their respective dual spaces, though this is irrelevant to what follows). \n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that when we constructed positive examples above, the *center* word was our input word, and we hoped to retrieve relevant *context* words in the outputs. Note also that $\\mathbf{\\phi}$ embeds inputs, while $\\mathbf{\\psi}$ embeds outputs. Thus, it seems natural that $\\mathbf{\\phi}$ is a latent space embedding of center words, while $\\mathbf{\\psi}$ is a latent space embedding of context words. If a given word $w'$ is a context word for $w$, this means that when we run $w$ under the autoencoder, the component of the output corresponding to $w'$ is large. Let $\\mathbf{w}$ and $\\mathbf{w'}$ be the one-hot encodings of $w$ and $w'$ respectively. Then the output of the neural network on input $\\mathbf{w}$ is \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{w'}^T\\operatorname{sigmoid}\\left(\\mathbf{\\psi}^T\\mathbf{\\phi}\\mathbf{w}\\right) = \\operatorname{sigmoid}\\left(\\mathbf{w'}^T\\mathbf{\\psi}^T\\mathbf{\\phi}\\mathbf{w}\\right) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp\\left(-\\mathbf{w'}^T\\mathbf{\\psi}^T\\mathbf{\\phi}\\mathbf{w}\\right)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we digress slightly and shift our focus towards the classification perspective. Recall that from this perspective, the autoencoder is attempting to classify whether $w'$ is a context word for $w$ (for all possible $w'$ at once). We saw that if we run the autoencoder on the one-hot encoding of $w$, the component of the output corresponding to $w'$ represents a classification score for $(w', w)$. It's also strictly between 0 and 1, so we might be tempted to go out on a limb and interpret this as the **probability that $w'$ is a context word for $w$**. We would then have\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(w'\\text{ is a context word for }w) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp\\left(-\\mathbf{w'}^T\\mathbf{\\psi}^T\\mathbf{\\phi}\\mathbf{w}\\right)}$$\n",

    "One way to find a correct model is to gather some empirically valid tuples and attempt to maximize their probability under our model.

As discussed before, the large majority of examples drawn from actual text corpuses are negative, leading to class imbalance and slow training.

However, now we will concern ourselves with processing and tokenizing data as without it, LSA will not word very well. A token in NLP is the fundamental building block on which all training is done. A token is a string of contiguous characters between two spaces, punctuations marks, or any combination there of. An example of a token is a word, but it also includes numbers and abbreviations. A stop word is a set of the most commonly used words in the english dictionary. While on face it might seem like we should include these, the most common words are \"the\", \"be\", \"to\", \"of\", and other assorted prepositions and articles. Clearly these do not represent any underlying 'topic' so we shoudl removoe them. A stemmed word is one where extraneous elements such as plurals or tense changes are removed. While the those do somewhat affect the underlying topic, they do affect the math in generating said topics, so we should remove them."
